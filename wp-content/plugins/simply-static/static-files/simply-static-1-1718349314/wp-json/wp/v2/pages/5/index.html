Within Oracle&#8217;s innovative environment, I am tasked with <strong>evaluating<\/strong> these models and agents, while also leveraging <strong>reinforcement learning<\/strong> (RL) techniques to enhance their capabilities. This involves designing experiments, developing <strong>intelligent agents<\/strong>, and exploring novel RL methods to optimize LLM performance. Through collaboration with cross-functional teams, I strive to translate cutting-edge research into practical solutions, driving progress within Oracle&#8217;s technology landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">2022-2023<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> As a <strong>Senior Data Scientist<\/strong> at <strong>Mastercard AI Garage<\/strong>, transformative efforts were led to enhance account intelligence scores for issuing banks, a <strong>$20 million product<\/strong> for <strong>Mastercard<\/strong>. Through innovative techniques like <strong>EDA, pseudo-graph, and target encoding<\/strong>, a significant <strong>four-fold increase in fraud capture rate<\/strong> was achieved by improving AI scores for <strong>account reload and reissuance<\/strong>. Additionally, a unique <strong>recalibration method<\/strong> based on issuing banks&#8217; <strong>event rate<\/strong> was devised, bolstering <strong>customer retention<\/strong>. Furthermore, pivotal contributions were made in developing generative AI-based applications, including an end-to-end internal chatbot, interactive dashboards, and a multimodal chatbot. Notably, the deployment of <strong>graph neural networks (GNN) for fraud prediction<\/strong> earned recognition with the esteemed <strong>AI Excellence Award for Quarter 2 2023<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2021<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Software Engineer 2<\/strong> at <strong>Citrix RnD<\/strong> India, worked in the Citrix Gateway team involving ICAProxy and HDXInsight protocols.
